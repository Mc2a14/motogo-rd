# Step-by-Step GitHub Setup

## After Creating Your GitHub Repository:

You'll see a page that says "Quick setup — if you've done this kind of thing before"

### Copy Your Repository URL
It will look like one of these:
- `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git` (HTTPS)
- `git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git` (SSH)

### Then come back here and tell me your repository URL, or run this command:

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` and `YOUR_REPO_NAME` with your actual values:

```bash
git remote add github https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git
git push -u github main
```

I'll help you with the exact commands once you share your repo URL!
